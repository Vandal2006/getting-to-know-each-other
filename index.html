<h2 style="text-align:center;border: 4px solid white;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Hi, my name is Henry Gilson, Just call me Henry. I like kayaking and playing video games in my spare time. Recently got out of the army, and now im starting my education in computer science hoping to start a career in it. I'm looking forward to covering both AI, and the world wide web, they both seem very interesting in how much impact they have on the world. I don't think there is really any topic I dread but I guess maybe binary values and number systems, just sounds like it could be confusing.</p>
<h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The basics of python and other often used programing languages</li>
    <li>How to make my own website</li>
    <li>How to make an AI that will take over the world for me</li></ul>
<h4 style="border: 4px solid blue;">My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h4>
<p>I love kayaking and getting into the great outdoors. Sadly the weather or and because of time restraints I don't always get to do that, so I will also often spend my time indoors playing video games or building models.</p>
<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
<p>I've never had anything from the Wendy's breakfast menu.</p>
<h5>Greatest Innovation in Computer Science</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web">The creation of the internet!</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/the-computer-science-behind-dna-sequencing/">Thanks to computer science, projects like sequencing the human genome was made possible.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_email">Of course email, how else could we all receive the spam we so desperately desire.</a></li></ul>
